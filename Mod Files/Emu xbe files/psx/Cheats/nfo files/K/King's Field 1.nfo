Note 1:
With this code, an example on how to use them: say you wanted the Stone Hands and the Silver Arms. You wouldn't enter the codes from the first list because two codes having the same address will mess up. You would enter the one code listed in the second list.

Note 2:
With this game, items with the name of "A" were blocked out in the American version, and given the name "A" to save space. I have no idea what these items do, any feedback would help.
