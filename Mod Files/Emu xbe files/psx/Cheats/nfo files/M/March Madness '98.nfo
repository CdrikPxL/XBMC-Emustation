Note 1:
With these codes, just go to the ability you wanted Maxed out and press right to add a number to it. It will go to 100. Also the Stat codes might lock up the game during play so I would Create Your Player then save, cut the codes off and then restart.

Note 2:
With these codes, only use one of them. At the start of a game, the momentum meter is always for the Home Team. So if you any of these codes, it will be for the Home Team.
