This will document all the changes to the Madmab Edition interface which essentially affects all emulators when they are compiled.  This will make tracking emulator differences for me easier seeing how I have 30 plus emulators under my belt.

The interface version used by an emulator can be found in the help menu (example: CFv1b01 ).  If it is not present then the emulator has not been compiled since this change.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b32 changes ...

* Commented out a line that was resetting the refresh rate thus preventing users from taking advantage of "Force PAL50 Mode" to get 50hz speed in 720x480 or 640x480 mode (even though the screen ratio is incorrect).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b31 changes ...

* Delete game configuration modified to remove "inputmap.cfg" and "mednafen.cfg" for the MednafenX series of emulators.

* Minor change to the manual screenshot advancement code as well as fixes for Vice64 not properly displaying screenshots from the screenshot directory.

* Fixed issue where menu state was sometimes not being reset to MAIN_MENU when exiting a game (for example pcsxbox not starting because of a bad cue file).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b30 changes ...

* Fixed an issue where changing the software filter in-game would cause a crash (Neogenplus GX core only)

* BoxCart art and screenshot textures are cleared on game start to help free up a little memory before launching a game.

* Removed redundant code.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b29 changes ...

* Running any emulator on a PAL50 system with videomode 640x480 and Force PAL 50 set to No would cause a crash (black screen).  Fixed.  :)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b28 changes ...

* Fixed were it was possible to lower CDDA volume and MP3 music volume (background music) below 0...

* Fixed issue where setting the game screen size/position to other than Pixel Accurate would reset the flicker fixer, software and hardware filters to ( 0, point, and none).

* Fixed another case where the UI was not going back to the "ROM directory" when changing default directories.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b27 changes ...

* Fixed Issue where background music was not stopping when running actual original CD games (for emulators that support it) if user has it set to turn off on game start.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b26 changes ...

* Fixed issue where CDDA mp3 volume adjust code had a little bug where if using the dpad to change the volume and it was changed to less than 0 or greater than 100 it would produce wacky numbers.

* Fixed issue where calls to function selectFile() were not resetting the xtras names and causing the currently selected game to be messed up.  For example, selecing a new controller config and then trying to load a new disk into the drives.

* INI file is no longer saved after manually changing the volume with the analog sticks due to potential INI file corruption on systems with wonky analog sticks and the user just powering off the xbox.

* I somehow reverted the synopsis code that allows the use of higher def backgrounds.  Fixed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b25 changes (PAL60 version :P ) ...

* Added support for 640x576 PAL mode.  So now you PAL and PAL60 users can enjoy using it!  The new mode called "640x576" is located in the slot reserved for 480p (since it is not available on HD sets).  You can set the menu video mode to this or you can set the game video to this for some PAL sized goodness.  Great for systems like the C64 or Amiga in PAL mode.  We currently do not have any accurate pixel settings for this mode except for Winuaex.  So any input is appreciated.

* When in PAL or PAL60 mode the video mode 720x480 in-game uses a refresh of 60 like it should.  However if you really insist you can use the "Force PAL 50 mode" to change that.  However the screen will be stretched and 720x576 is the better option anyways for 50hz modes.

* Fixed issue for PAL60 users where wrong video mode is highlighted when changing the video mode.

* Fixed a minor issue for PAL60 users where refresh rate was not being set properly when changing the interface video mode.

* Fixed a minor issue for PAL60 users where refresh rate was not being set properly to 50hz when changing the game video mode.

* Disabled some code that was initializing Video on game load (was not needed).

* Fixed an issue where if pixel perfect settings were not defined for the 720x modes and they were used the screensize variables would be set incorrectly.

* To save confusion the interface now asks you if you want to "Activate Default Game Configuration Use?" if you set the default game configuration and the option is not turned on.

* New option added for "Pixel Perfect" users "Use Offsets From Pixel Perfect Table? (Yes/No).  You'll only see it if "Pixel Perfect" is activated.  It is located under "Configuration -> Video Configuration -> Game and Text Screen Size/Position".

- This is a new feature that will be added for certain emulators to help center the screen a little better based on a comparison to the real console.  The Amiga is a little different so be sure to read the "latest_winuaex.txt" file.

* SelectFile routine was modified to place the selection on the closest matching filename if the passed filename variable contains a value.  (hopefully this wont cause odd behavior)

* Added a new Preset controller option in the Controller menu modified "Overwrite Existing Controller Config".  It will allow you to save the current settings over an already existing preset controller file.  If you changed the settings (which clears the loaded preset controller) it will remember the last name used to help save you some time.  If you want to create a new presetC just use "Save Current Controller Config".

* Added new option in the General Settings menu (Page 2).  "Pressing BLACK Deletes Game Settings Only? Yes/No".  Having this set to yes will delete a games configuration settings but will preserve other things like SRAM saves, save states, and recordings.  "No" will completely remove any files associated with a game.  This setting carries over to the newly added "Game Save Management" menu.

* "Game Save Management" now brings up a new menu with the following options.  

"Remove Settings & Saves Per Game" -> This option will allow the user to select individual game configurations and will completely remove any files associated with a game.

"Remove Only Settings Per Game" -> This option will allow the user to select individual game configurations and will delete the configuration settings but will keep other things like SRAM saves, save states, and recordings.

"Remove Only Settings For ALL Games" -> This option will go through every game configuration that exists in your saves folder and will delete the configuration settings but will keep other things like SRAM saves, save states, and recordings.

* "skin_settings.ini" in the saves folder is now "settings.ini".  If the emu finds "skin_settings.ini" it will rename it to "settings.ini" and then from that point on use "settings.ini".  This is to make it easier to copy into the actual skin's folder if you like your settings.

* When going into "Change default directories" and changing the "ROM Directory" the game select screen switches to the newly selected default directory instead of going back to the old one.

* Sticky left analog sticks should no longer cause hangups at the game select or game favorites menu.

* Some more optermizations to the :showScreeshot function (sigh).

* Changed it so if "Always Display Save State Menu?" is set to Yes there will be no popup asking "Overwrite existing state?" if "Confirm Save State" is set to "Yes".

* Changed text on "Volume Control Menu" from "MP3 Music Volume" to "Background Music Volume" to be less ambiguous.

* Some tweaks to the synopsis display code to, hopefully, fix some issues when using the pop-up window.

* Somehow accidently removed the code to display a skin's synopsis background image if one is included.  Whooopsie!  Fixed.

* Synopsis tries to convert some oddball international characters into ones that will display properly on the xbox. (Open/close quotes, etc).

* Created a new alternate "directory" layout for artwork files. This was mainly created to fix speed issues with game browsing on asphodel's C64 Xtras collection (which is huge!).  Artwork can now be stored in alphabet folders underneath each respective directory.  For example "Action\0", "Action\A", "Titles\Z", "Titles\S".  This applies to all folders except for the MISC folders.  In order for the emulator to detect that you are using this new layout there has to exist an "Action\A" folder (no files needed inside).  Otherwise the emulator will use the old artwork layout.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b24 changes...

* Autoload savestate code in commonfuncs fixed to deal with multi-core emulators.  Affected emulators were pcsxbox (reloaded and redux), snes9xbox, NeoGensPlusGX and MessTrex.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b23 changes...

* Fixed a bug with the xbox_compatible_name code that would fudge up the extension of a filename longer than 42 characters and with a space before the filename extension, thus losing the extension.

* Fixed a synopsis bug where selecting a CD image on a networked drive would copy the image over to the xbox.  This issue did not affect PCSXBOX.

* Modified action list load code and synopsis viewer to handle Amiga CD32 images.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b22 changes...

* Added an "About" menu to the "Utilities" menu to display info about the emulator core.  This info will be added in each emulator when they are next released.

* Added in support for multiple accurate pixel entries for multi-core systems rather than the two seperate list approach previously used.

* Merged in the e:\saves\ fixes from a test build.  What this means is you can now point the "saves" directory elsewhere (like F:) and the emulator will remember that.  This should also mean no more "hex-editing" XBE's to split up multi system emulators!

Note: If you have an ini file for the emulator (example: winuaex.ini) in the emulators directory.  Be sure to remove it before running any emulator that has been update to CFv1b22 and above.

Basically the emulator works like this.

1. Check "D:" drive (the emulators directory) for the ini file and load.

2. If present and emulator is being run from DVD, reload INI settings from saves directory specified in the ini file. This allows a user to modify emulator settings (except for save directory) if running from DVD.

3. If no ini present check default saves directory "E:\Saves\emuname" for ini and load.

4. Last resort... if unable to load ANY ini file use defaults.

So how do you get this to work?

1.  Create a saves directory where you want it to be.  For example ( F:\saves\emuname ).

2.  Either edit the .ini file to point to the new location or you could just load up the emulator and point it to the new saves directory.

3.  Exit the emulator.  The ini file is then saved to the emulators directory (D:).

4.  Move your saves to the new location.  It should be safe now to remove your e:\saves\emuname directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b21 changes...

* Load/Save state code modified to handle dual cores for NeogenplusGX.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b20 changes...

* Only first Misc artwork directory was being displayed across a network share.  Fixed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b19 changes...

* Fixed issue with screen size/position randomly changing when using global override and custom screen/size position.

* Based on user feedback removed the following software filters 2xSai Scanline, 4xSai Scanline, Super 2xSai Scanline, Super 4xSai Scanline, Eagle 2x Scanline, Eagle 4x Scanline, Super Eagle2x Scanline, Super Eagle4x Scanline.

*********************************
* New Scanline Software Filters *
*********************************

* Added 6 new software filters from GensX and 2 from NeoGeo CD emulator to the the x-port arsenal.  

* They are as follows Scanlines Filter and Scanlines 50 Filter from NeoGeo CD and Full Scanline, Interpolated Scanline, 50% Scanline, Interpolated 50% Scanline, 25% Scanline, Interpolated 25% Scanline from GensX.

* These will be added to emulators as I can and will be reported in each emu's latest changes text file.

* Here are the current rules for the scanline filters..  These may change as more testing occurs.

The filters can be found in the "software filter" section towards the end of the list.

-------------------------------------
When you select a new scanline filter
-------------------------------------

If the game video mode is an HD mode the hardware filter will be changed to bilinear filter because the point filter does not look right unless Y pos is set to -1 and who wants part of the top of their screen missing. Flicker filter Level will be left alone.

If the game video mode is an SD mode the flicker filter level will be set to 2. Hardware filter will be left alone.

-----------------------------------
When you change the game video mode
-----------------------------------

If the game video mode is an HD mode and the software filter is a "GensX scanline filter" the hardware filter will be changed to bilinear filter because the point filter does not look right unless Y pos is set to -1 and who wants part of the top of their screen missing. Flicker filter Level will be left alone.

If the game video mode is an SD mode and the software filter is a "GensX scanline filter" the flicker filter level will be set to 2. Hardware filter will be left alone.

----------------------------------------
How the video size/screen position works
----------------------------------------

With the exception of "custom" video size/screen position. If you have the software filter set to a "GensX Scanline Filter" then the following rules apply. Otherwise it does what it always did.

If the game video mode is an HD mode the hardware filter will be changed to bilinear filter because the point filter does not look right unless Y pos is set to -1 and who wants part of the top of their screen missing. Flicker filter Level will be left alone.

If the game video mode is an SD mode the flicker filter level will be set to 2. Hardware filter will be left alone.

*********************************
* End Scanline Software Filters *
*********************************

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b18 changes...

* Software and Hardware filter are no longer saved with each individual game configuration.  Consider it effectively "global" now.

* Video mode is now changed when sizing the screen if you are using a custom size and the game video mode is set to something other than the interface video mode.  For emulators that have game specific video modes, set the screensize while in-game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b17 changes...

* Sound is now paused on game "exit".  To (hopefully) prevent sound stuttering on exit.

* Fixed issue where selecting the root directory with the A button would crash the emulator.  an oversite when I was modifying the game selection code.

* More cleanup of the screenshot display code.  

* Fixed left/right d-pad browsing code on the favorites menu.  Also fixed issue on game select menu when number of files in a directory is less than lines displayed by the skin.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b16 changes...

* Fixed issue where interface was improperly numbering the savestates for Snes9xbox core 1.53 and thus you could save a state but not load it.

* You can now disable the "Launch Inserted CD" option menu in the "Dummy/Lockdown Mode Settings" menu for emulators that use have this option.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b15 changes...

* Fixed issue on emulators that use individual game modes where the interface video mode was reverting to a games video mode if the xbox was turned off before exiting the game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b14 changes...

* Fixed issue where game browser would revert to displaying normal filenames instead of long filenames when the file browser is used in-game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b13 changes...

* Fixed some issue with the manual screen advance code.  In particular manual advancement of box/cart art when the display time is set to 0.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b12 changes...

* Saving screensize/position globally somehow got borked.  Hopefully fixed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b11 changes...

* File select menu allowed you to add/remove files from favorites or delete game saves even when you were not in the game select menu.  Fixed.

* The indexes for box/cart art size/position were all wacked out causing some skins not to display boxart.  However some skins do not have their orientation options set correctly so you might have to fix that first.  Sorry for the big goof.  All of my testing were done with the official skins by Gilou999.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b10 changes...

* Option to display static if no movie exists got borked.  Fixed.

* Fixed the bubble sort in the unzip routine.  Whoopsie.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b09 changes...

* Manually changing screenshots after first highlight of a game was not working correctly so if you had an action and some misc screenshots it would display the misc screenshot first.

* Hardware filter being changed to bilinear for some reason when using on screen keyboard in SD modes (for example the "save controller configuration" option.  Fixed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b08 changes...

* Fixed a nasty bug related to allowing long filename to be passed in createlocal and unzipfile.

* Default option for exactSecMatch in GetIniInt and GetIniString was reversed.  Corrected it.  Reversed entries in :ShowGameSynopsis and :LoadGameButtonList as well.  Updated all emulators that have a gamebase config to use the new format.

* Moved "Show Action List Instead of Keyboard" option for emulators that use it into "commonfuncs" where it belongs.  Currently atarixlbox only.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b07 changes...

* Added support for HD synopsis backgrounds.  However transitions in the synopsis are disabled if one is used.

* Modified game select screen so if the game selected is at the midpoint in the list it will scroll the screen instead of waiting till you reach the top or bottom.

* Corrected list positioning bug that occurs sometimes when backing out of a directory (controller Y) (filelist shorter than maxnumlines).

* Fixed a couple bugs in the "Go to next letter (dpad-right)" code.  (While loop).

* Fixed a bug in the "Go to next/prev letter (dpad-right/left)" code when in favorites and using longfilenames (xtra).

* Fixed a glitch in the "Go to next/prev letter (dpad-right/left)" code regarding directories when using longfilenames (xtra).

* Disabled mp3 volume controls in the media browser (graphics / manuals / etc ) because it conflicts with the "sizing" controls.

* Disabled mp3 volume controls in the synopsis viewer to prevent accidental adjusting of the volume while hopping in/out of synopsis view.

* Adjusted the text in the dummy/Lockdown mode menu ( for SD mode )

* Added two new options to the Dummy/Lockdown mode menu.  "Prevent MP3 Vol Change In Game Select Menu? Yes/No" and "Prevent Movie Vol Change In Game Select Menu? Yes/No"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b06 changes...

* On emu's that have an NTSC filter the option to change the software filter is not shown if the NTSC filter is active ( still needs changing on atarixlbox and classic99x? )

* Dual code for handing individual game screen size/position and global game screen size/position so either one can be used depending on the emulator.  Emulators currently affect..
  global -> ( MekaX, Xboyadvance, WinstonX).  Individual -> ( X68000X, Winuaex, Dosxbox )


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b05 changes...

* Modified createlocal and unzipFile so that they can return the longfilename if one exists (external files or within ZIP)

* Modified GetValuePopup so it can handle increments other than 1 and numbers with decimal (some math required on your part :P ).

* When selecting a file within a zip Pressing B to cancel would not close the zip file, thus preventing it from being selected again.  (fixed).

* Fixed a bug with the IGM that would prevent some emu specific options from working properly.  Not sure how this one slipped by for so long.  :lol:

* Modified game volume control so it can now control emulators where the core is MESS (aka A7800x)

* Fixed a lockup bug in the action list "showGameControls" function.

* doConfigureController and doConfigureControllers now return whether a change to the controller settings was made.

* Now clears the Preset Controller name when the "Copy Configuration" option is used like it is supposed to.

* YesNoMenu modified to allow selection of default response (yes or no).

* Added new menu to "Xtras menu" to allow toggling debug output to file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b04 changes...

* Minor changes to allow proper action list support for DosXbox.  No effect on other emulators.

* Minor fix to the manual browsing code that would have affected DosXbox.  No effect on other emulators.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b03 changes...

* Fixed some issues involved with moving to the previous/next file when viewing manuals from within a zip file. (all emus)

* Fixed another issue involved with moving to the previous/next file when viewing manuals from within a zip file in emulators that use the alternate unzip routine.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b02 changes...

* Fixed an issue with samba share browsing on certain routers.  All I know is it now works on ARRIS routers used by Time Warner Cable and possibly others.

* Added ability to show Box Front images from "Box Front 01" directory.  For now it is Box Front only.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface CFv1b01 changes...

* Fixed some bugs in the displaying of sprites in the IGM.

* Added a new skin menu option "Select Static IGM Background Image".  This can be found in the "All 'Other' Menu Settings" menu.  It allows the skinner to have a background image other than the "other" menu background while in the IGM.  The idea is that when in the IGM the least amount of memory is available.  This helps with cases where sprites just wont display while IGM (long story).  If you use this feature the IGM sprites will be disabled and the emulator warns you of this.  To "disable" the static IGM backgroun menu just select the option and press "B", thus not selecting a file.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Madmab Edition Interface changes pre CPv1b01

This will be updated later.  For now just look at the "Latest-emuname.txt" and "Readme-emuname.txt" files.
