Note 1:
With these codes, I have tested all them and they do work. However if you use all of them at once the game may freeze. The best solution I have found for this is to enable only one hitting/fielding code and one pitching code. Then when you begin creating your player, all you need to do is try to take points off of the stat that is maxed out. When you do this the bar will not move, but you will be able to hear the sound it makes when you actually do take points away. Then just begin adding to the other stats. The original bar will remain full but you can still get points from it to add to the other stats.

Note 2:
With this code, Press Select while in the game to make this active.
