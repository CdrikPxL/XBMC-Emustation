Note 1:
With these codes, only use one set of codes per level.The invicible code and super jump code should be used together, do not seperate them. Lava will still kill you. Turn off invincible code to kill bosses.Turn the Shark off at the title screen. Enter the level the codes are for, and when Croc can move freely, turn the Shark back on. Turn the Shark off before you ring the gong at the level's end.
