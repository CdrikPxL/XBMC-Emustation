Note 1:
With this code, we need some better descriptions for some of them. The hidden characters names/descriptions are the following: Soul Edge (Playable), Siegfried! (Playable), Han Myong (Playable), Bangu (Playable-Another Form Of Seung Mina?), Botsu Lilong (Not Playable-Glitches When Loading Stage), Diver (Playable), Monkasei (Playable-ODD, it says Seung Mina for the name, but its obviously not Seung Mina, and he does not have any weapon.), Chie (Playable-Another Form Of Seung Mina?), Sophitia! (Playable), Hagesieg (Playable, Once again, it says Seung Mina for the name and its obvious its not her.), Teppou Hei (Playable-Same description as previous character.), Nugi Taki (Playable-Another Form Of Taki?), Sophitia!! (Playable), Belti (Playable, Whoa, Says Sophitia for the name, but its obvious that its not. Its a silhoutte of a character, looks kick ass).
