Note 1:
With this code, once you have selected this code from the Action Replay Menu you must wait for the Action Replay cartridge to reset the PlayStation and once the PSX logo is displayed, switch off the Action Replay cartridge (move the switch into the down position). Once Cool Spot has loaded, start the game and then move the switch back into the up position. This should let you play with infinite lives and energy
