		<name>The Addams Family</name>
		<desc>The Addams Family is a side-scrolling platformer based on the movie of the same name. The player takes the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family members.

		<name>The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin</name>
		<desc>The game is based on the famous 1990s animated series of the same name. The player takes control solely of Batman, as the Joker has kidnapped Robin in order to lure Batman into a game. Furthermore, the Jokers lets Gotham&#39;s most feared criminals compete with one another in order to distract Batman. Naturally, Batman has to take care of the other master criminals, too, while trying to free Robin.&#xA;&#xA;The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin is 2D platformer/ beat&#39;em up. The goal in each stage and level is to walk from left to right to reach the (sub)boss and the end of the stage. To beat his foes, Batman uses punches and kicks in close combat and several weapons for short distances. Batman has an unlimited supply of Batarangs with him from the beginning, and there are four more weapons available. Apart from simple jumping, Batman can also perform a double jump to reach higher places and can hold on to ledges.</desc>

		<name>Aerial Assault</name>
		<desc>In Aerial Assault, you play the Freedom Fighter who must destroy five targets, including the Vinsk, CB-53 Bomber, &amp;quot;El&amp;quot;, and two cliff fortresses. During each of the five missions, you will encounter enemy jets, choppers, submarines, jeeps, parachute bombs, and several other enemies in which you must destroy. Shooting either the spinning fighters or the small flying helicopters will earn you a power-up that allows you to upgrade or downgrade your firepower. There are three difficult settings: &amp;quot;Easy&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Normal&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Hard&amp;quot;. You will not be able to complete the game if you select the &amp;quot;Easy&amp;quot; setting.</desc>

		<path>./Aleste.zip</path>
		<name>GG Aleste</name>
		<desc>In the first installment of the Aleste series for the GG, you play as Ellinor Waisen, the daughter of the original Aleste pilot Ray Waisen.&#xA;As usual, your task is to exterminate level upon level of nasties with your space ship. The usual Aleste powerup systems remains fairly intact. You still have powerup pods which release P capsules for upgrading your main weapon. On the other hand, secondary weapon upgrades are no longer released from ground bases, but from another type of flying pods. When you start out, your secondary weapon is a laser, which can later be replaced with powerups ranging from split fire to napalm rockets and target seeking power balls. Both primary and secondary weapons are in constant use, since only button 2 is used for firing both weapons at once. Due to the smaller screen estate of the Game Gear, the sprites are larger and the playfield more constrained, for which the game compensates somewhat by introducing multidirectionally scrolling sections.</desc>
