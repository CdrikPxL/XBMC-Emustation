With this code, it will not save levels unlocked that are after the Current Position. To save the levels, start on the level where you want the game saved, and then when in the game, save your game.

Note 9:
With this code, notice that whenever an enemy is in your sight, the enemy comes from a certain area by you. The enemy will not leave the spot where he would come from, even when he sees you. The only thing is is that when you get within the enemies attack range, it can attack you, so dont go near them! This will make the game alot easier.
