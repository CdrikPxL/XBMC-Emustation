Note 1:
With these codes, if you want to make a perfect player type in the infinite points and unlock the limit codes. Then start the game, after the Cheat Device loads, turn off the Cheat Device. Then goto create player screen and name the player and stuff. When you get to the points turn on the Cheat Device (make sure your not holding any buttons on the controller when you turn it back on because i did that one time and it frozed) and make the guys points to a hundred (i never tried over a hundred). Then turn the Cheat Device back off. Goto the backup options and save the created player. Now you have to reset the playstation because if you go back to the create player screen it will freeze. If you want to make another player repeat the process, but make sure you load up the created players that you made, before you create the next player so the next player you make will add to the list. It may take awhile to make a bunch of players but thats the only way i found it to work right. Its worth the time too.
