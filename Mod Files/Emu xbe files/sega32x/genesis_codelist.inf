;This Cheat Database has all the codes from the official Galoob Genesis/Megadrive Game Genie [293 Games]
;Also included are custom Game Genie codes from: "The code Hut" http://www.angelfire.com/games2/codehut/index.html [about 276 Games]
;This database was made in compliance with the "Madmab Ed. Xport: NeoGensis Emu"

;I was spending hours converting/putting this together by hand 
;(like I did on the NES database) and then I had the bright idea to ask the good Bomb Bloke
;if he could make a scripts to covert these easier. He could and he did and made 
;this possible with great ease. it still ended up taking me hours and hours of editing. - Mega Man (?)
