Note 1:
With this code, after you load the codes turn the GS off and then when the races starts turn the GS on then flip it back off. Do this each time a race starts and you will have Lapped the opponents once and have a 63 second timer. If you don't flip the GS off you will continue to race on Lap 2 forever.
