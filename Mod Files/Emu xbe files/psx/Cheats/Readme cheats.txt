Cheat Database for PCSXBOX

Things to note:

1. Dominator01 has included many nfo's to accompany the cheat lists for certain games.

2. If you ever see a [Note] next to a code then you should check the .nfo file for info on the code.

3. Games have been split up for convenience of finding codes quicker.

For example.

(Character Codes)
(Other Codes)

Character Codes will have anything related to the games characters... (Stats, Weapons, Armor, etc)

Other Codes contains things like. Infinite Money, Walk Through Walls, etc etc

4. Games needing changed values have either one of two messages after them

(Add 8-bit Value) - Needs last 2 digits
(Add 16-bit Value) - Needs last 3 or 4 digits

30078932 00?? - is an example of a code that needs an 8-bit value
80078932 0??? - is an example of a code that needs a 16-bit value
80078932 ???? - is an example of a code that needs a 16-bit value

Replace the ? with digits. Sometimes this may be to do with a certain item, or an amount of something etc

For example.


Exp Modifier (Add 16-bit Value)

Note if you had the code 80078932 ???? replacing the ???? with a big number means lots of experience... FFFF lotsa exp, 0001 not much. Keep in mind that there may be more than one 16-bit code for exp:

80078932 ????
80078934 ????

Again the same rules, big number, lotsa exp. small number - small amount.


Item Modifier (Add 8-bit Value)
Slot 1
30078932 00??

This code will modify the item in the first slot of your item menu... changing the number will change the item.

Dominator01 has included nfo's with the values of certain items. "Eg. 01 might be a potion and 02 might be an ether"

30078932 0001
Potion in slot 1

30078932 0002
Ether in slot 1

Item Amount Modifier (Add 8-bit Value)
Slot 1
30078932 00??

This will change the amount of whatever item is in slot 1...

30078932 0003
will put 3 of that item in slot 1


Thanks to dominator01 for putting together codelists, bomb bloke for the converter, madmab and xport for the emulator... and lastly to anyone who plays the emulator, have fun :D
