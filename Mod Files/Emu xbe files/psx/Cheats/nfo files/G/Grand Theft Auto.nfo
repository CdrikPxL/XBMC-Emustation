Note 1:
With this code, it is a very fun and kewl code yet very buggy! So I added a kill button just incase you get stuck! Ok #1 DO NOT run a car off in the water while in it! If you do thats what the kill button is for just hold it down and you die! Some missions may glitch just hit the kill button and the board should reset..Its good to use infinite lives with this hehehe! Those are the bad points of the code. The good points are when you die...tap the car jacking button,run button,and firing button all while pressing left or right to wiggle your dead body back up...basically resurrection hehehe! You can walk over water,can't get busted by the cops,and you are immune to electric shock & fire! Also if you blow up in a vehicle you can wiggle back to life from it also!The Kill button is set on the brake button which is by default R1...if you want to stop the vehicle just tap the brake button never hold it down!
